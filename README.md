# A react, redux saga with typescript.

## Motivation

We have received many things from the open-source community this is just an attempt to contribute something back. Aim was to create a simple project with all the basic stuff that most applications need. For example, 
1. Navigation/Routers
2. Form library
3. State managers 
4. A javascript utility library
5. Error handling tools
6. Analytics 
7. linting tools
8. Test suits configuration and a few more

So this project contains all of the above mentioned items and few others

## What it contains?

A simple react typescript project with react-redux and saga configured with connected-router, react-router, and a bunch of exciting libraries. Some of them are listed below
1. [Connected react router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router) This helps you to navigate/update route from anywhere be it saga or action and also maintains all activity inside state, which helps in tracking the page changes and grab other navigation related information
2. [Redux](https://redux.js.org) Helps in managing application state
3. [Redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) It helps you to persist your state even you close your application
4. [React Hooks form](https://react-hook-form.com) A simple but powerful form library
5. [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) A javascript utility library 
6. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) Well, this if fun to play with
7. [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org) This can do all your work, make api calls, modify your state data, capture errors and most importantly it helps you seprate your logic part from view.
8. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) I can't think of a better lightweight, promise-based HTTP client.
